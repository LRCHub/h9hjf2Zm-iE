You know it's alright
Just to take me home
To your serious house, with your serious tones
You're a serious man, with a serious smile
But the summer is hot and I might surprise you

In a very short while we'll have left them behind
With their faces quite pained
As they try to remind themselves
Oh, it's really so wrong
It's really so out
And it's really not cool to take a young girl about

And I know the young man with a century's face
A philosopher king - he will try to amaze
With examples of love and examples of hate
And to see them explode
We will just have to-

It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine

You know it's alright to be trustful, have tact
But the problem's complex
When you keep holding back
We could talk for an hour
We could talk for a day
But the people we know will still have their say

Talk of virtuous women
Talk of such noble men
But if I'm on that level I have met none of them
Oh, I've met troubled people with deep and dark thoughts
Who have hallowed my name
And sworn I will get caught
But why waste real feeling?
And why waste our time?
To let the earth bow to no virtue of-

It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine

You know it's alright to just make mistakes
But to taint it with hurt is the gravest make
We all create lives which we don't understand
But to point the accused is a job for no man
And we curse our own longing, and curse our own ways
I won't be satisfied with my soul that's-

It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
Now I've told you about mine
