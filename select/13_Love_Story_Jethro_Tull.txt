Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has changed her mind, yeah.
I know what i will find
That she is wasting time,
She could be picking roses.
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has seen the light, yeah.
Oh, i told her last night
She should improve her sight,
She could be painting the roof.
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has come around, yeah.
She offered me no sound,
Her head is in the ground,
She could be calling for winter.
