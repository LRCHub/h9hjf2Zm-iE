Steal a diamond and pierce my heart with its point
And take three silver drops of blood
To sow your dried flesh

Use the harvest you get to appease the hunger of your crowd
Which drains you day by day
Draining you away
Yeah!

You wanna eat my pearly eyes
To fill the void, you've got inside
Sweet child of mine, you've got inside

The pearly gates you dream of
Are made of mortal hopes
You stole away

The pearly gates you long for are made of
Innocent night beings
Heavenly unpure, and yet so pure

I feel ashamed for your soul
This war seems to reach a crying end
But why?

Your very tears, they never fall
Your very mask, it never fades away
Your very face ain't going to be shown
(Going to be shown, going to be shown, going to be shown)
